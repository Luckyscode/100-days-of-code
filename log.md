**Today's Progress**:Finally finished setting up my coding enviroment,I also learnt how to use the command line and some git basics which assits in pushing code to github i learnt this by creating my very own repository

**Thoughts:** last year when i first started i used to think Git and Github are of the same company,until i learnt otherwise. tomorow i will be be going through the [html and css foundations lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations)
