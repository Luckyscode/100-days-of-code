## why I decided to join

From december 2022 throughout 2023, after surfing and wandering on the internet looking for information about web developmet and software engeering, I came across the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) curriculum. When i began learning starting with html and css, I was really excited and unsure but  each day I was on my computer screen  learning the enthusiasm and curiosity i had kept expanding.

when i then started learning JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures things started to change,the exercises became harder, I started procrastinating for days and sometimes a couple of weeks and my motivation had  lost its adrenalin, i was inconsistent , I still want to learn all that i needed to so i found myself jumping from different videos on youtube. I was just consuming information without actualy going over what i have learnt

that is why i have decide to join the 100 Days of code challenge to help me in creating consistent study habits ,and the descipline to start and  finish  a course once i start it.During the 100 days and i will be documenting  and sharing my daily progress  as i progress through the course.

I will update the [log](Log.md) with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress, I will also share my progress every day on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/_lu.ck.yy?igsh=MWt6dDF4Yzlkcnozcw==) using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode.
