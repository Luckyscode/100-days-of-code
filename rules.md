# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least two hours every day for the next 100 days.*

#### Start Date
Sun 07 Apr 2024 

## Additional Rules



1. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
2. I will update the  [log](log.md) with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
3. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge. 
4.  I will also share my progress every day on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/_lu.ck.yy?igsh=MWt6dDF4Yzlkcnozcw==) using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode.
